# Alloy cluster expansions

This directory contains several notebooks that support the [section on alloy cluster expansions](https://tif345.materialsmodeling.org/toward_applications/cluster-expansions.html) (CEs) in the lecture notes.

* `introduction-to-cluster-expansions.ipynb`<br>
  This notebook provides a simple introduction to alloy cluster expansions in Python using the [`icet` package](https://icet.materialsmodeling.org/).
* `ce-with-covariance-matrix.ipynb`<br>
  This notebook shows how to use the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix to couple parameters, using a cluster expansiosn for a surface system for demonstration.
* `correlation-in-cluster-expansions.ipynb`<br>
  This notebook shows that the columns of the sensing (or fit) matrix obtained for cluster expansions are correlated.
